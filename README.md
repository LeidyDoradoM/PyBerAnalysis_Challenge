# PyBer Analysis

In this week project we are going to analyze data for **PyBer** - a *ride-sharing app*- with the purpose of generating plots that helps to understand trends and relationships between total number of drivers, rides and fares by type of cities. From the analysis and plots, *PyBer* could take decisions that improve the access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Overview

After an initial analysis of the data, we need to create a ride-sharing dataframe and a multiple-line graph of the total weekly fares along 4 months for each city type, that allows us to gather insights about the differences among the three city types: *Urban*, *Suburban*, and  *Rural*.
